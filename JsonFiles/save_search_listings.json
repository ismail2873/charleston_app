{"id":"19","restaurant_id":"nV3mHV8OSn-AQjnmNxoKew","name":"Marina Variety Store Restaurant","description":"Perched on the edge of the Ashley River at 17 Lockwood Drive, Marina Variety Store Restaurant has been serving Charleston locals and visitors since 1963. It’s not flashy or trendy — and that’s exactly the point. With its weathered charm, marina views, and plates piled high with Southern favorites, this casual waterfront diner is a beloved fixture in the city’s food scene. The atmosphere is comfortable and unfussy, with nautical décor, big windows overlooking the water, and a local crowd that knows exactly what they came for: reliable, hearty food and a slice of authentic Charleston tradition.\r\n\r\nBreakfast at Marina is legendary and served all day, drawing early risers and late brunchers alike. The menu leans into classic Lowcountry comfort, with options like fried pork chops and eggs, corned beef hash, pancakes, and French toast, all made fresh and portioned generously. One of the standout dishes, the Bear Island, combines shrimp, smoked sausage, onions, and peppers over creamy stone-ground grits — the kind of satisfying, soulful meal that sticks with you in the best way. Whether you’re craving something savory or sweet, Marina’s breakfast game is strong and built for appetites that mean business.\r\n\r\nAs the day rolls on, lunch and dinner menus bring seafood front and center, honoring Charleston’s coastal roots. You’ll find local shrimp, fried oysters, flounder, scallops, and soft-shell crab when in season — either served up in platters, po’ boys, or sandwiches. The Folly River Crab Dip is a must-try appetizer: creamy, seasoned just right, and served with toasted bread or crackers for dipping. For those not in a seafood mood, there are burgers, salads, daily soups, and hearty meat-and-three-style plates. Marina doesn’t shy away from generous portions or bold seasoning — the flavors are honest, rooted in the South, and cooked with love.\r\n\r\nWhat really makes Marina Variety Store special isn’t just the food — it’s the feeling. You’ll often find the dining room filled with a mix of locals, city workers on break, retirees reading the paper, families gathering for weekend breakfasts, and travelers lucky enough to stumble in. Despite changes in ownership over the decades, the restaurant has stayed true to its original vibe: no gimmicks, no flash, just quality food, fair prices, and an unbeatable view. The staff is friendly, efficient, and clearly used to welcoming back regulars — a testament to the restaurant’s loyal following and community roots.\r\n\r\nOpen Thursday through Sunday from 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM (and until 2:30 PM on Sundays), Marina Variety Store is ideal for everything from sunrise breakfasts to laid-back seafood dinners. Whether you're a longtime Charlestonian or just visiting, a stop at Marina offers more than a meal — it’s a nostalgic step into a place where tradition still sits at the table.

{"id":"165","restaurant_id":"dsK5Tkxo3W-xxTeUIsp3Hw","name":"The Peacock","description":"Located in Charleston’s historic French Quarter at 213 East Bay Street, The Peacock isn’t just a restaurant—it’s an experience layered across four dazzling levels. With over 12,000 square feet of space, this art deco-inspired venue offers something for every type of guest, whether you’re in the mood for a chic brunch, elevated dinner, rooftop cocktails, or a night of dancing. The Peacock seamlessly blends modern elegance with Southern style, making it one of Charleston’s most dynamic and stylish dining destinations.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of The Peacock’s culinary vision is Executive Chef Matt Greene, who curates a bold and imaginative menu that fuses American classics with global influences. The first floor dining room, open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, features standout dishes like hashbrown bites topped with caviar, lamb lollipops, Southern-spiced chicken, fresh seafood, and elegant salads. Whether you’re starting your day or indulging in a lavish evening meal, each plate is crafted with creativity and flair. On weekends, brunch takes center stage, both indoors and on the rooftop. Favorites like smoked salmon plates, shakshuka, and gourmet breakfast sandwiches draw both locals and visitors looking to enjoy a relaxed but refined morning.\r\n\r\nAs the sun sets, The Peacock transforms. The second floor opens up into the Peacock Lounge—a vibrant cocktail bar with a moody, upscale vibe that serves as a venue for both intimate evenings and private events. Just beyond the lounge lies **V’s**, a speakeasy-style hideaway that takes nightlife to the next level with live jazz, DJs, themed parties, and events like the ever-popular “Soul Train Saturdays.” This blend of culinary craftsmanship and immersive entertainment sets The Peacock apart from more traditional Charleston venues.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the crown jewel is the rooftop lounge, offering panoramic views of the Charleston Harbor and a plush, open-air setting that feels more Miami than Lowcountry. With three private VIP sections equipped with personal TVs and cozy seating for 10–12 guests each, it’s an ideal spot for celebrations, bachelorette parties, or simply sipping cocktails under the stars. The rooftop menu mirrors the elegance of the dining room below, with small plates and curated drinks perfect for sharing.\r\n\r\nThe Peacock also shines as a private event venue, with space to host everything from corporate gatherings and birthday dinners to full buyouts for weddings or large parties. The building’s layout and versatility make it one of the few spots in Charleston that can offer such a wide range of atmospheres—from sleek dining to rooftop revelry—all under one roof.\r\n\r\nWhether you're visiting for a romantic date, weekend brunch, or high-energy evening out, The Peacock delivers a full sensory experience: culinary sophistication, captivating ambiance, and curated entertainment in a single location. The Peacock adds a bold, vibrant new beat to Charleston’s dining and nightlife scene.","phone":"+18439555226","is_featured":"0","display_phone":"(843) 955-5226","rating":"4.5","review_count":"170","categories":"","address":"213 E Bay St","city":"Charleston","country":"US","state":"SC","website":"https:\/\/thepeacock-chs.com\/menus\/","latitude":"32.78045323451599","longitude":"-79.92730959692138","image_url":"https:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/kvYS-uY3m1HTpZIFwpDwWQ\/o.jpg"},
